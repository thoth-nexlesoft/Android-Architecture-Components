# AndroidMVVM
This repository contains a detailed sample app that implements Android Architecture Components using Dagger2.

## The architecture
The following diagram shows all the modules in our recommended architecture and how they interact with one another:

## The Android Architecture Components 
1. [Android Architecture Components Overview](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/guide.html)
2. [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata.html)
3. [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel.html)

## Network module
1. [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/)
2. [Okhttp](http://square.github.io/okhttp/)

## Dependency injection Framework
I'm using [Dagger 2](https://google.github.io/dagger/) library to implementing dependency injection in Android apps. Dagger 2 automatically constructs objects by walking the dependency tree and provides compile time guarantees on dependencies.


## Next version
I will intergrate with local database. You can learn more at : [Saving Data Using the Room Persistence Library](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/index.html)
